# Getting Started with React Components & React Hooks

My project - https://katerinashchuka.github.io/react-mui/

This assignment requires also TypeScript when passing props to React Components

## Requirements

1. Create a simple one-page application to store incomes and expenses, and set
saving target.
2. Account balance can be calculated from incomes, expenses, and saving.
`incomes - expenses + saving = balance`
3. Users should be able to add new incomes, expenses, transfer from balance accountt to saving account, and reset saving target.
4. Use React Hooks where applicable. TypeScript must be used at least for the props types.
